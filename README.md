# scala xlp titan extruder holder
a mount option for the titan extruder on a scalar xlp

Since the proposed mount options for the titan extruder on a Scalar
XLP didn't work for me, i designed my own.

This mount has the advantage, that you can easily remove the whole
extruder easily to perform, e.g. calibration

And you keep easy access to the pressure knob and the filament release
or advancing wheel.
